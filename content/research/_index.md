Our group is keen to understand how androgens and estrogens affect brain functions, particularly on how these hormones control mitochondrial functions in the healthy and diseased brain in a sex dimorphic manner. 

We are currently investigating these research areas:

1- The effects of synthetic hormones (e.g. tibolone) on mitochondria metabolism.

2- Hormonal signaling affecting cellular outcome, and how important this is for mitochondrial respiration under traumatic brain injury in presence or absence of hormones.

3- Dysregulation of lipid metabolism within mitochondria and neuroimmune response following brain trauma.

4- Drug design and development of new drugs analogues to hormones for targeting mitochondria
