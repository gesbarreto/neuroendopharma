# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: Dr. Barreto earned his PhD in Neuroscience (2009) from the Universidad Complutense Madrid (Spain) studying the effects of neurosteroids on reactive glia with traumatic brain injury under the supervision of Professor Luis Miguel Garcia-Segura. His Post-doctoral training in Neuroscience at Stanford University School of Medicine (2009-2011), under the mentorship of Professor Rona G. Giffard, focused on addressing the role of astrocytes activation following stroke and enhance astrocytic functions targeting neuronal protection. With the collaboration of Professor Carla J. Shatz, also from Stanford, Dr Barreto and cols discovered that both PirB receptor and MHCI molecules are involved in the physiopathology of stroke by regulating astroglia activation and behavioural outcome. Nowadays he is a Lecturer in Cell Biology/Immunology in the Department of Biological Sciences at the University of Limerick (Ireland), is a member of the Bernal Institute and Health Research Institute from the same University.
